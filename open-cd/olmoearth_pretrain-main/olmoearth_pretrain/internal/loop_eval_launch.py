"""Launch in-loop downstream evals as separate Beaker jobs.

Used by :class:`~olmoearth_pretrain.train.callbacks.evaluator_callback.DownstreamEvaluatorCallback`
when ``run_as_beaker_job`` is enabled. Instead of pausing training to evaluate the
*live* model, we launch a Beaker job that evaluates the just-saved checkpoint via
``checkpoint_sweep_evals.py``. Training continues uninterrupted while the eval job
runs (and queues) independently.

This reuses the existing checkpoint-eval machinery end-to-end:
``checkpoint_sweep_evals.py`` already loads ``step{N}/`` checkpoints from a directory,
runs the same downstream evaluators, and logs metrics on a ``checkpoint_step`` wandb
x-axis -- so eval metrics are plotted against the training step they correspond to,
regardless of how far training has advanced by the time the eval job finishes.

Notes / constraints:
* The eval job reads a *saved checkpoint*, so the eval step must coincide with a
  checkpoint save (see ``launch_checkpoint_eval_job``'s existence check). In practice,
  set the evaluator ``eval_interval`` to a multiple of the checkpointer's
  ``save_interval`` (and prefer permanent over ephemeral saves so the checkpoint is
  not deleted before the eval job loads it).
* The spawned launch reuses the parent job's environment (``REPO_URL``, ``GIT_REF``,
  ``BEAKER_TOKEN``, ``WANDB_API_KEY``, ...), exactly like a manual ``launch_evaluate``.
